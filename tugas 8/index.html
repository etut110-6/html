      The Japanese driver has endured a difficult 2025 campaign so far after
      being moved into the senior <i>Red Bull</i> team from <i>Racing Bulls</i> after just two
      races, swapping places with <i>Liam Lawson</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, team mate and reigning four-time World Champion <i>Max Verstappen</i>
      has taken two victories and sits third in the <i>Drivers' Championship</i>, while
      <i>Tsunoda</i> has only managed three points finishes, the last of those coming
      at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix back in May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of this weekend's Dutch Grand Prix, Tsunoda admitted that the summer
      break had put into focus what he needed to achieve over the remaining
      races this season in order to try and secure himself a spot on the grid
      next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been a while since I scored points but at the same time, in those
      moments I didn't score points I also knew that I was [going] in the right
      direction and especially the last two races before the summer break after
      I got upgrades, I kind of proved to myself and proved to them that I'm
      still there.

      as struggled to get near the performance of team mate Verstappen this year
      "Its good that I'm able to show some performance there but at the same
      time obviously it's a team, that's why I need the points and what I need
      to do for the second half."
    </p>
    <p>
      Speculation has continued to grow over the season over who will partner
      Verstappen at the team next year, with <i>Isack Hadjar</i> a possible option
      having impressed in his maiden F1 season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tsunoda admits that facing such pressures is nothing new, having been part
      of Red Bull's driver pool since his F1 debut back in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's the usual story in F1. This situation, those kinds of
      pressure is part of the world and part of, not sure you can say the
      beauty, but it is what it is," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just focus on myself. I got used to it with these kind of rumours in
      the last five years but I understand also at the same time, the second
      half [of the season] is really important for me as well, so I just keep
      pushing and put it all together."
